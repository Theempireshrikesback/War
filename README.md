# War
As I started with python I thought it would be cool to build a program based on the card game "War". 
My first "success" was to get two players to randomly draw a card and compare them, it even tracks the score and declares a winner at 20 hands.
I plan on re-working and re-posting this code to reflect my evolving control of the languange.
